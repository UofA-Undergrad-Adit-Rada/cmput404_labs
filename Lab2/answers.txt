Q1) By specifying socket.SOCK_STREAM
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        ...

Q2) A server socket listens on a host and a port, receives requests,
     and then sends a response to the client who initiated the socket connection.
     The client socket is what sends a request to that server socket, and waits for a response.

Q3) By using setsockopt:
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

Q4) We get the client socket, the client's address and port.

Q5) The bytes sent by the client.
